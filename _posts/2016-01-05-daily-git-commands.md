Git commands are massive and chances are, you only need a small subset of them in daily usages. So here are the common git commands that I used daily:-

Undo last commit:-

```
git reset HEAD~1
```

Abort merge:-

```
git merge --abort
```

Set color on output (by default git already use color but not on OSX):-

```
git diff --color
```
