Hello, this is the first series of updates on software development that we hope to do on weekly basis.

1. [Gitlab Pages](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/80) (akin to Github Pages) [is coming to gitlab.com in this 22/12 release](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/)
2. Google [Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml) project. This might be an [old news](https://googleblog.blogspot.my/2015/10/introducing-accelerated-mobile-pages.html) but we've just picking it up today. It is an attempt to make static web content load faster. This is particularly of interest to content publisher such as media company and being viewed as Google response to Facebook Instant Articles.
3. Django Project [received a massive grant](https://www.djangoproject.com/weblog/2015/dec/11/django-awarded-moss-grant/) from Mozilla Open Source Support (MOSS) program - $150K that it will be used to fund development of, among other things HTTP2, background tasks and websocket support.
4. [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) Beta [released](http://angularjs.blogspot.my/2015/12/angular-2-beta.html). Now maybe a good time to start looking into the framework if you're still on Angular 1.
5. This is more than a week old but we listed here for it's significance. A [new Android emulator from Android Studio 2.0 Preview](http://android-developers.blogspot.my/2015/12/android-studio-20-preview-android.html) ! We all know how slow the Android emulator is and this one claimed to fix that.
6. ReactOS, an OS project that try to build an open source Windows fully compatible OS from scratch finally [reach an RC (Release Candidate)](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/reactos-open-source-windows-clone-173145859.html) stage. If you're old enough to be on the Internet, you'll realized that this project was started 17 years ago !
7. [Rust 1.5 released](http://blog.rust-lang.org/2015/12/10/Rust-1.5.html). Rust is a system programming language aimed to offer better alternative than C/C++ for writing system program.
