title: Week 3 Dec 20015 Updates
---

Hello, this is the first series of updates on software development that we hope to do on weekly basis.

1. [Gitlab Pages](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/merge_requests/80) (akin to Github Pages) [is coming to gitlab.com in this 22/12 release](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/)
2. Google [Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml) project. This might be an [old news](https://googleblog.blogspot.my/2015/10/introducing-accelerated-mobile-pages.html) but we've just picking it up today. It is an attempt to make static web content load faster. This is particularly of interest to content publisher such as media company and being viewed as Google response to Facebook Instant Articles.
3. Webfaction (disclosure: my favourite shared hosting) has added [support for PHP7](https://blog.webfaction.com/2015/12/php-7-is-here/) in it's hosting package.
